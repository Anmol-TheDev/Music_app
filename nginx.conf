# Nginx configuration for a Vite Single Page Application (SPA)

  # This block is key for SPA routing (like with React Router)
  location / {
    # Try to serve the requested file ($uri), then a directory ($uri/),
    # and if neither is found, fall back to serving index.html.
    # This allows the client-side router to handle the URL.
